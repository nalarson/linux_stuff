# Multi-booting your PC
or "How to get your proprietary, monolithic PoS OS to share"

Please note, these instructions assume use of the KDE desktop in Debian Linux. If you're attempting this, you should have little problem adapting to other desktops and distributions.

## Put Linux on a bootable USB stick
(Coming soon)

## Put Windows on a bootable USB stick
(Coming soon)

## Nothing installed yet
(Coming soon)

## If Linux is already installed

1. Back up your drive if you're concerned about losing existing data (hasn't happened to me yet, but I've only been doing this for 20 years).
2. Boot from the Linux live USB.
3. Open App menu > System > KDE Partition Manager.
4. Resize the partition(s) on the drive to make room for the new install. Recommend giving Windows a bit more than Linux, since Windows and its applications tend to take up more space than Linux. (Gotta have room for all that crappy outdated code.)
5. Reboot from the Windows USB stick.
6. Install Windows. Skip entering a product key at this time.
7. Finish installing, making setting selections that leave your computer insecure and wide open to Microsoft, advertisers, and PII data resellers. Wait for it to finish setting up your computer, cleaning up, and saying "Hi". Spend this time asking yourself why a commercially produced OS developed by thousands of highly trained and well paid engineers takes three times longer than an open-source OS written by a scrappy rag-tag bunch of volunteers to set up.
8. When it's finally done, reboot from the Linux live USB.
9.
